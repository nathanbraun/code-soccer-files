# README
These are the files for the book [Learn to Code with Soccer](https://codewithsoccer.com).

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click the `Source
code` link under the latest release to download the files.  This will download
a file called `code-soccer-files-vX.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the latest
version.

When you unzip these (note in the book I've dropped the version number and
renamed the directory just `code-soccer-files`, which you can do too)
you'll see four sub-directories: `code`, `data`, `anki`,
`solutions-to-excercises`.

You don't have to do anything with these right now except know where you put
them. For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/code-soccer-files`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\code-soccer-files`

Set these aside for now and we'll pick them up in chapter 2.
